# RepairShopEstimationAnalysis

## Introduction To Problem
Final Exam STAT 500 â€“ Summer 2020
Problem: You work for a small, local automotive insurance company.  The owners are concerned that the two repair shops they use are providing significantly different estimates in repairing damaged cars.  If true, this can lead to higher payout costs for the company resulting in higher premiums charged to customers in turn leading to customers switching to a competing insurance company.  Overall, this problem puts the survival of the company in peril and your job in jeopardy.  The owners come to you asking for assistance as you are the only employee with any statistical knowledge.  Their question is straightforward: Is one of the repair companies charging more than the other repair company? #Paired T-Testing, would be the best solution: others would be linear regression, binomial, two-sample t-testing.
